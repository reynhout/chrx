## fixes for suspend/resume

## set list of devices that are capable if triggering a wakeup.
## each echo toggles device status; each device is capable on boot,
## so any devices listed here will become incapable.
##
## LID0 Lid Switch
## TPAD Touchpad
## TSCR (prevent wakeup immediately after sleep) (no longer needed?)
## HDEF (unknown)
## EHCI Enhanced Host Controller Interface (USB controller)
## XHCI Extensible Host Controller Interface (USB controller)
